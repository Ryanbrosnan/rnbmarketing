                    1.1.
                    <br> The Services: R'n'B Marketing will provide the services described in the Quote/Production Estimate as presented. As an assignment develops, it may be that the scope of the required work changes. Where this is the case, R'n'B will seek to discuss it with you at the earliest opportunity in order to agree upon any variations to the scope of the Services and the Quote/Production Estimate, which may be necessary.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    1.5. <br>Force Majeure: Think Creative Agency shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform their obligations where such delay or failure to perform arises from circumstances outside Think Creative Agency’s reasonable control.
